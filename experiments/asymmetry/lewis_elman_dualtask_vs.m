% Each hemisphere gets the same inputs, but performs a different task.
% Each hemisphere learns both tasks.
%
% So, this is like asymmetry_parity_shift, but both sides learn both tasks, and know what to expect from the other.
%
% A good comparison is to asymmetry_parity_or_shift (where each learns one task without knowing what the other side will do)
%   and asymmetry_parity_shift (where the same relationship holds here, but each hemi learns just one task)
